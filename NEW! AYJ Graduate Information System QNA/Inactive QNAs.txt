I might take a year off after high school (a gap year). Can I apply now, and if I get accepted, can the university to defer my acceptance until next year?
Deferral policies vary from university to university. Some universities allow deferrals, others do not. Some universities may grant a deferral, but request that you re-apply after your gap year (and pay all the associated application fees again). If you are interested in deferring admission, you must contact the university directly.
